17/Oct/2022 Adding some more text, I think the last time I did this I did not save and thats why it never showed up on git lol
            I decided to use this space to note down the stuff I have learned doing the odin project, As you can see today 
            I have went through using Git for the second time. The first time was the Git_Test this time it is the TIL. Besdies this
            I covered the introduction to HTML and CSS on the Odin project. HTML = Puts the info on a webpage CSS = Positions the info on the web page

18/Oct/2022 Today I created "My first webpage" I did this when I was in secondary school but this time it makes sense to me which is good. I tried
            to add an image to the webpage without using google but I could not figure it out so I will wait for it to come up further on in the odin project
            The word "charset" reminds me of "charmandar" in pokemon. I also forgot to mention I could not get the webpage to work as I typed my code in the 
            Text edit app on mac lol once I opened it in VScode and saved it then worked for me.

19/Oct/2022 Today I created another new webpage which I also added to git. I learned how to create numbers lists and also un numberlisted lists.
            It was handy enough to understand, I am excited to move on to some more stuff that may be a bit harder. Today I am also tired lol. Also one last thing
            I keep forgetting to click save and then I do be confused as to why git says everything is up to date lol.
